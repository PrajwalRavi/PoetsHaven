SONNET 40: TAKE ALL MY LOVES, MY LOVE, YEA, TAKE THEM ALL
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE
Renaissance
Love
Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all:
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.
Then if for my love thou my love receivest,
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;
But yet be blamed if thou this self deceivest
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
I do forgive thy robbry, gentle thief,
Although thou steal thee all my poverty;
And yet love knows it is a greater grief
To bear loves wrong than hates known injury.
    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
    Kill me with spites, yet we must not be foes.
